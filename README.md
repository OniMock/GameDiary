## 📖 Overview

**GameDiary** is a background kernel-mode plugin (PRX) and a premium user-mode application (EBOOT) for the PlayStation Portable (PSP).

It exists to give PSP power-users modern, console-like play tracking capabilities. GameDiary automatically monitors the games you play (both native PSP titles and PS1 classics via POPS), records your session lengths, extracts the game icons behind the scenes, and presents all your gaming statistics in a beautiful, modern, and fluid UI.

**Key Benefits:**
* Never lose track of your gaming hours.
* Revisit your gaming history via rich, data-driven graphs.
* Works entirely in the background without affecting game performance.

---

## ✨ Features

### ⚙️ Core
* **Seamless Background Tracking**: Minimal footprint kernel plugin starts silently with your games and records your playtime accurately.
* **Automatic Icon Management**: Automatically extracts `ICON0.PNG`
from EBOOTs and ISOs for a rich visual diary without manual scraping.
### 🎨 UI / UX
* **Premium User Interface**: Fluid carousel navigation, smooth
transitions, depth-sorted overlapping icons, and dynamic backgrounds built from the ground up to feel like native OS features.
* **Comprehensive Stats**: View total playtime, session history, and detailed graphs.
### 🧩 System
* **Internationalization (i18n)**: Fully localized in English, Spanish, and Portuguese with automatic detection based on PSP system settings.
* **POPS Compatibility**: Reliable tracking and icon parsing for PlayStation 1 classics running via the official emulator.

## ⚙️ How It Works

GameDiary operates in two layers:

1. Kernel Plugin (PRX)
   - Tracks game sessions in real-time
2. User Application (EBOOT)
   - Reads and visualizes collected data

## 📦 Installation

### 📋 Requirements
* A PlayStation Portable (PSP 1000/2000/3000 or Go).
* Custom Firmware (CFW) installed (such as PRO, ME, or ARK-4).
* A Memory Stick (or MicroSD to MS adapter).

### 🗂️ Folder Preparation
Ensure you have the latest release downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/OniMock/GameDiary/releases) page. The release contains two main components: the App and the Plugin.

### 1. Installing the Plugin (Tracker)
1. Copy the `gamediary.prx` file to your `seplugins` folder on your memory stick (`ms0:/seplugins/` or `ef0:/seplugins/` for PSP Go).
2. Open `ms0:/seplugins/game.txt` in a text editor.
3. Add the following line:
   ```text
   ms0:/seplugins/gamediary.prx 1
   ```
   *(Use `ef0:/seplugins/gamediary.prx 1` if using a PSP Go's internal storage).*
4. Do the same for `ms0:/seplugins/pops.txt` to enable PS1 tracking.
5. Restart your PSP (or reset VSH).

### 2. Installing the Application (Viewer)
1. Extract the `GameDiary` app folder.
2. Navigate to `ms0:/PSP/GAME/`.
3. Copy the `GameDiary` folder there. Your absolute path should look like `ms0:/PSP/GAME/GameDiary/EBOOT.PBP`.

## 🚀 Usage

### ▶️ Launching the App
Simply navigate to your PSP's **Game** menu on the XMB and launch **GameDiary** like any other homebrew.

### 🎮 Controls

| Button | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **D-Pad Left/Right** | Navigate carousel / Select previous/next game |
| **Analog Stick** | Smooth scrolling through the game carousel |
| **Cross (X) / Circle (O)** | Open detailed game statistics (Respects region config) |
| **Triangle (△)** | Open application settings / Options menu |
| **Square (□)** | Change graph sorting modes |
| **L/R Triggers** | Fast jump between letters/pages |

### 🔄 Example Workflows
1. **Playing a game**: Boot up a UMD or ISO. The plugin silently detects the game ID, extracts the icon if missing, and begins tracking your playtime.
2. **Reviewing stats**: Run the GameDiary Application from the XMB. Scroll through the carousel to find your game, hit **X** (or **O**) to view your weekly and all-time playtime statistics.

## 🛠️ Configuration

GameDiary data is stored inside the `ms0:/PSP/COMMON/GameDiary/` directory to keep your Memory Stick tidy.

* `games.dat`: Master database mapping game IDs to playtime statistics.
* `config.ini`: User-defined preferences. You can override system language strings or toggle UI features here.
* `source/`: Cloned icons representing your played games, automatically managed by the plugin.

## 👨‍💻 Development

GameDiary is built using the standard [pspdev implementation of the PSPSDK](https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev).

### 🧪 Building Locally
1. Ensure `pspdev` is installed and the environment variables (`PSPSDK`, `PATH`) are configured.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OniMock/GameDiary.git
   cd GameDiary
   ```
3. Run `make` to compile both the PRX and EBOOT:
   ```bash
   make clean all
   ```

### 🐳 Docker
Alternatively, use the official Docker image to compile without setting up local tools:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}:/workspace" pspdev/pspdev Make clean all
```

### 🖥️ Running on Emulator
The user-mode application can be tested using [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/). Testing the kernel-plugin typically requires a real PSP, though specific module debugging can sometimes be simulated with advanced emulator setups.

## 🔌 Plugin Details

The tracking system relies on kernel thread manipulation and syscall hooks to calculate precise uptime accurately.

* **Tracking**: On game boot, the plugin initializes a monitor thread that synchronizes with the `sceKernelGetSystemTime` API, appending delta-time entries to disk upon shutdown or hibernation.
* **Isolation**: All file I/O operations inside `gamediary.prx` use low-level `sceIo*` functions guarded by thread-safe mutexes to prevent crashes when interacting with active game threads.
* **Limitations**: Some homebrew that aggressively overwrites RAM boundaries or custom interrupts may temporarily pause tracking intervals.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Background play tracking and database mapping.
- [x] MSDF font rendering and multi-language support.
- [x] Auto-extraction of `ICON0.PNG` for PS1/POPS Eboots.
- [ ] Expand UI features with thematic templates.
- [ ] Export stats to JSON/CSV for external use.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Architecture First**: Respect the separation between `app/` and `plugin/`. Avoid kernel functions in the user-mode app unless specifically bridged.
2. **Memory Mindful**: The PSP has limited RAM (32MB/64MB). Avoid unnecessary deep copies and dynamic allocation (`malloc`). Prefer stack allocation where safe.
3. **Open a PR**: State clearly what your pull request fixes or implements. Ensure your code merges cleanly and builds under `pspdev`.
